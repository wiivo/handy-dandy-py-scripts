# Wiivo's Handy Dandy Python Scripts

Crafted for my own personal and specific needs :)

## my_ytdlp.py

Greatly simplifies ytdlp so I can download video and audio without having to look up cheat sheets every time. (Originally badly written in C++)

## vegas-dejunk.py

The video editor Vegas stores the wave forms of newly imported videos to special .sfk files. These tend to build up and create clutter, so this simple script deletes any .sfk files of nonexisting (or all) videos in a directory to clear up space.
